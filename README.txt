I thought it would be nice to take the concept "Conway's Game of Life" and add food to it.
I am assuming Conway was trying to model the basics of high order life, my goal was more on
the basics of low order life. The code is not fully optimized to keep it easier to modify
the rules encase some of the underlining logic was wrong.

Differences
1) No loneliness
2) Individuals grow
3) Food is consumed

Basic Rules
1) If you have more then two and less then five nighbers the spot becomes alive.
2) You live until your food is gone
3) The more you grow the more you eat.
